The burdock never grows alone, but where there grows one there always grow several: it is a great delight, and all this delightfulness is snails' food.

Here and there stood an apple and a plum-tree, or else one never would have thought that it was a garden; all was burdocks, and there lived the two last venerable old snails.\n",
